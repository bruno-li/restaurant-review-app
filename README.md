# Restaurant Review App
=======================================

This offline first and responsive app project is part of the curriculum from Udacity Front End Web Developer.

# Main
=======================================

In this project our task is to make our app offline first to enhance user experience. It uses service worker to cache all files to be able to load content faster when there is a network issue or even offline. Also, another objective is to make the app responsive for all type of devices screens.


# How download and use app
=======================================

**Download** -  Click the "Clone or download" button then click "Download ZIP" and soon you'll get a zip file when your download finishes. Unzip the files.

**Clone** - Type into your terminal or command prompt the following: $ git clone https://github.com/leizifei/restaurant-review-app.git. 


# Launching the app
=======================================

1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8989` (or some other port, if port 8989 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8989`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8989`.

3. If you choose a different port for the server, remember to modify the file dbHelper.js to enter the correct host for your server.
